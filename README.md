# Coffee-Price-Analysis
Analysis of price received for coffee beans in the United States from 1967-2017, and the relationship between other agricultural products.


This is a project completed during my undergraduate studies.
Included in this repository is are:
- An Rmd file where the data is cleaned and analyzed.
  This file is documented with easy-to-follow explanations for each section.
  Various methodologies and models are used and evaluated, and ultimately a final model that maximizes the R-Squared value is selected.
  Numerous visualizations are also included.
- A CSV file containing the data from the USDA.
- A Word document containing the final report/writeup submitted along with the relevant data for the project.

This project was completed in late April of 2020 and has only been edited for clarity since.
